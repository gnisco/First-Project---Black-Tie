Black Tie Attire
Stream One Project: User Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute

This is a website designed to advice veiwers on how to dress appropriately for a black tie dress code. It shows all the different pieces that should be worn and informs them of the way to wear each item and which are the correct ones to be worn, it also informs them about the history of black tie and how it came to be.

Demo
A live demo can be found here https://308049fc47b4423caa49eacdad8b4aab.vfs.cloud9.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/_static/index.html.

UX
My goal in the design was to make it very traditional and antique but with a minimalistic approach as I didn't want too much clutter. Hence a grey/white/cream theme was used to create the antique feel as it is trying to represent a classic topic.

CSS
Bootstrap (4.2.1)

Credits
Content
The contents are about black tie and were written off my own knowledge from previous work in a menswear store, but https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_tie was used to help me explain the history aspect.

Media
Most of the photos were taken from https://www.hackett.com/gb/home with 1 photo from https://www.prada.com/gb/en/men/shoes/lace-ups.html, this is because I was unable to find suitable photos elsewhere on open source websites and so have credited these website in the footer

Acknowledgements
I used W3schools and the boostrap website to help with dividing my colums properly and making the cards in the accesories section.
