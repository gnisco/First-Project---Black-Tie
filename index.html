                                With a new middle class appearing in the 1800's their became a growing popularity among outdoor leisure activities as more people had the money and free time do so. However there was a problem in that the traditionally worn frock coats in that era did not allow for much moveability or comfort when performing such activites; and so in the 1860's a new lounge suit saw increased popularity amongst country estates.

                                With the day wear becoming more casual, so to did the evening wear as men sought out shorter dinner jackets in replacemtent for their long tailcoats due to comfortability. The Prince of Whales is generally accepted to be the first man to wear a dinner jacket in 1865 which was made at  Henry Poole & Co on Saville Row in London. It was considered informal wear at the time, even though it was worn with the same trousers and accesories a tailcote was worn with, and was only used in country estates such as sandringham

                           Their are only 2 traditionally correct colour choices, black and midnight blue. Although black was the most common colour used when the dinner jacket was introduced their are some records of midnight blue being used in the 1880's and it is a suitable alternative for those who find black a bit too dull as in low lighting midnight blue can look richer and darker than black due to the way the fabric takes to the dye.</p>

                       <p class="jackets-style">
                           The style of the jacket should be single breasted with a single button; although you may come across some double breasted variants which are acceptable however the single breasted variant is the preferred option. The pockets should be slit pockets preferably straight but a slight slant is acceptable and they shoould not have pocket flaps as these are less formal. The jacket should be finished with a peak or shawl collar lapel, the shawl collar was used first for the smoking jackets made with velvet in the 1860's and was considered less formal and more suitable for loungewear; the peak lapels were put onto the dinner jacket when it was made with black wool and considered the more formal option. However today both styles are equally formal and you may choose whichever one you like the look of most. The lapels can be made with either a grosgrain material or a plain satin finish and should always be black, even on the midnight blue variant.

                            The trousers you wear should match the jacket you have and so should only be black or midnight blue. They should also have tape on the outside of each leg made from either grosgrain or satin finish to match the lapel of the jacket you are wearing, the dinner suit is a complete look and it is important to maintain consistency throughout. The width of the trousers typically shouldn't be very slim and should have a decent width, by this we don't mean to have a bootcut leg but so long as the trousers aren't skin tight and can sit nicely with clean straight lines you are good. When you wear the trousers you don't want their to be many creases as this takes away from the formal look you are going for, and so with this in mind the length of the trouser is very important as you can't have it too long or you will get too much bunching of material above the shoe and it can't be too short as socks showing is a big no; one clean crease in the length is acceptable.
